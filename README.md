### Description
VeriTAS is a combination of a replay device for performing Tool-Assisted-Speedruns (aka Tool-Assisted-Superruns) on physical hardware, and software tooling that interfaces with the device and assists in other TAS replay tasks.

The RP2040 microcontroller is the brains of this device. This project is still in early development, but is intenteded as a replacement/continuation of my previous device the PICTAS.

### Software Tooling
The VeriTAS software is a Rust CLI tool that can perform various TAS replay related tasks, such as automated TAS dumping and video transcoding. It also is used for interfacing with the VeriTAS hardware.
